EXAMPLES OF CHAT GPT TO SPEED UP GuiProgramming

Question about how stuff works & intor ot new concepts
Code review
Helping me find bugs
Optimization
Helping me with design choices and how to execture
    for exmaple describe what im trying to do and how i think i should implement it and ask GPT for its opinon and if its right way to do, that way for more complex stuff that is at the edge at my ability I wouldnt have to write it only to find out it does'nt work and so more efficent.
Consulting about whether good idea
Creating boilderplate code
Checking between things to make sure they line up.
    To ensure that the parameters used in the instantiation of Task objects within the TaskManager class are correctly aligned with the headers in the corresponding CSV file. I am very bad at doing this proficenly so GPT is a huge help.



Code Verification: ChatGPT helped verify the alignment between CSV file headers and the dictionary keys used in the code. This was crucial for ensuring that data from the CSV files was correctly mapped to the attributes of the Task class objects without any mismatches.
Error Troubleshooting: Whenever we encountered errors or exceptions, ChatGPT assisted in diagnosing issues and suggesting fixes. This included identifying problems with argument handling in function calls (e.g., handling TypeError related to unexpected keyword arguments).
Refactoring Assistance: ChatGPT provided guidance on how to refactor complex function calls to enhance readability and maintainability. This included using dictionary unpacking for passing multiple keyword arguments and simplifying the initialization of class instances.
Documentation Aid: ChatGPT aided in documenting the code and processes, ensuring that all modifications and the rationale behind design choices were well-documented, enhancing the understandability for other developers and future maintenance.
Coding Best Practices: By suggesting best practices in Python coding, such as the use of .get() for safer dictionary access and the effective use of keyword versus positional arguments, ChatGPT helped maintain a high standard of code quality.

# Ideas List üí°üìù

A living document for potential new features, design ideas, and longer-term enhancements.

## Program & Feature Ideas

- **Night Chores**  
  - Possibly schedule night chores by time or after a certain event (like "sweeting").  
  - May tie in with flexible ‚Äúwindowed tasks‚Äù logic.

- **Employee & Time Slot Improvements**  
  - Implement unique employee IDs for clarity and to avoid name conflicts.
  - Consider using enums or a configuration object for timeslot management (military time vs. named slots).
  - Potential for dynamic timeslot editing (user can update timeslots in a config and the system adjusts automatically).

- **Scheduling & Assignment Extensions**  
  - Weighted probability for who gets assigned (preferences + future needs).
  - "Everyone assigned at least once" logic with fallback tasks if not assigned. 
  - Multi-select or bulk editing for tasks in the UI (less clicking, more efficiency).

- **Task Priority & Tier System**  
  - Automated tiering logic based on historical frequency, user preferences, or critical need.
  - Smart off-week system for tasks that occur sporadically.

- **GUI Enhancements (Long-Term)**  
  - Calendar or Gantt view for tasks (instead of just cards).
  - Role-based permissions and user accounts.

- **Packaging & Deployment**  
  - Mac DMG or Windows Installer for easy installation.
  - Potential web app deployment with Flask or a similar framework.

Completed Tasks List:

GENERAL / OTHER-----------------
#DONE via editior / complete incomplete tasks take remaining slots and ones that require user input off the diplay / desribe list and edit list???? idk how to deal with them. atleast take cusotm ones off, can ask what they want spare slots to be.
#DONE wonder if i can sort obj and durations together via dict, then just get the keys and make list and it would be faster?
#DONE, originally was problem bc check against windowed and windowed wansnt getting updated unless queue prematurely full, so have add to that list here
#DONE LEARNING CONCEPT - SOLVED (looked at another csv without \ufeff) Its because I needed to give a encoding parameter to the open() func. why is \ufeff a thing.

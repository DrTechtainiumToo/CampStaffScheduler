To run mypy:
mypy .

python -m cProfile -s time your_script.py
This runs your script with Python’s built-in profiler, cProfile, sorting the output by execution time (the -s time option). It shows you which functions take the most time, so you can identify bottlenecks.

snakeviz profile.prof
After saving your profiling results (for example, by redirecting cProfile output to profile.prof), you can run this command to launch Snakeviz—a graphical, web-based viewer that makes it easier to explore the profiling data visually.

#TODO When developing, leave all gui stuff for after complete main program. Bc might have app take care ofall of that and the program just take the final type and ver of data and use it.
#So keep in mind when making inputs or conversion sequences that it has a clear final form and document it. That way can plug into api requests easy and stuff.

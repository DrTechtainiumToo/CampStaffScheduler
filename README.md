Incomplete Camp Staff Scheduling Application


An incomplete and partially broken, messy, complex, overreaching, vast, poorly documented and designed, first real attempt at a serious coding endevor. Wanted to make a scheduling program for the summer camp i worked at. Never finished becasue was taking up too much time, there was no need for it, and i had achieved by main goal of learning python.

Learned alot though

### **Is the Mac Quick Start Installing Dev Dependencies?**  
**No, the current Mac quick start installs only the runtime version.**  

üîç The command in the **Quick Start (Mac Users)** section is:  
```sh
poetry install  # Install runtime dependencies only
```
This **does not include** dev dependencies. If a user wants dev tools, they need to explicitly install them using:  
```sh
poetry install --with dev
```

---

### **‚úÖ Corrections & Clarifications**
1. **Clarify that the default Mac setup is for the runtime version.**
2. **Provide an explicit option for dev setup in the Quick Start section.**
3. **Fix `poetry init` in Step 2** (it‚Äôs **not** needed unless creating a new project).
4. **Fix `poetry install --no-root`** ‚Üí `poetry install --no-dev` is clearer for removing dev dependencies.

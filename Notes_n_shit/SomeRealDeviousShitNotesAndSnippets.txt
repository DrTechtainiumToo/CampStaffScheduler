#TODOLIST bc my dumbass has 1mb of working memory ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#TODO Redo defaultInfo csv file, storage, retrevial, and interpetation system. Now need to ad gender column too
#TODO Create save system for preferential stuff that you dont want to type in repeatedly but cant be in defaultInfo, will have to maeke csv readers & converters tho
#TODO Finish getting all the time and special events listed
#TODO Create master task list (just add some stuff some like 80% there)
#TODO Preferences system
#TODO Time system, how work? its input blocks or time date, or give options. also make smart function to calc distance btwn two numbers to get duration, will have to maeke csv readers & converters too tho
#TODO Importance system
#TODO Multi-timeblock system
#TODO Merge all input data into master roster for algorithm
#TODO Actually devlop algorithm - will be a pain in the ass week long affair probbably
    #TODO Probability system
    #TODO Sort system and arrange data for selectioin
    #TODO Anti Overlap System
    #TODO A bunch of other algorithim stuff
    #TODO Error Log, Exceptions, & Final Error Report System
    #TODO prob a bunch of other shit I forgot
#TODO Format Console Output (Potentially scrapped)
#TODO Format CSV / Excel Output --> Core Feature
#TODO Decide if format for google sheets or app plugin (Somewhat likely)
#TODO Decide if format for web application deployment via Flask and Google Cloud (Highly Likely)
#TODO Potentially make gui to make input easier??? DO AFTER Decide on output format
#TODO Final review of entire system for user friendly-ness changes and bugs
#TODO Review to ensure scalability
#TODO Documentation
#TODO Bug Reporting and Diagnostic Mechanism - maybe make an internal log that saves each time you use and had a toon of data so if there is a glitch, or at the end fo the program it asks the user any glitches, if yess then saves to log which i can look at later and user can also make comments on messsup.
#TODO Clean up comments and consolidate learning experience and examples maybe at the end to show what learned?
#TODO Cry
#TODO Get user feedback, incoperate feedback & iterate
#TODO Finalize & Deploy

#PROGRAM OVERVIEW --------------------------------------------------
#load in default info, employee gender info & nickname, basic tasks & stand duration, timeslots, & nightchore
#Ask for special tasks for the day and relevant info, also determine based on date user inputs what are some routinly occuring speical events that need to be accounted for.
#Generate Total Tasks
#People Avialable for day (Check for exceptions), *also find out partial avialibilites*
#Timeslot
#Tasks due in timeslot & number of people per task
#Rank tasks in importance
#See how many ppl avail in timeslot, then check if enough people  to complete tasks for that timeslot -> throw exception if isnt list shortage amount, 
#then base on importance list find how many task you can fill and then state what tasks cannot be filled, maybe in final log
#then take that list and save it in new variable to be used in the assignment loop for that slot???? idk, that way dont have to re calc in loop. (Could hurt multi timeslot assignments maybe??)
#(Req people task preferences???)
# MAKE THIS A LOOP, Assign tasks  until all needed tasks are assigned or no room / people to complete all task in slot (make sure (idk when in program) to define when task need done by / deadlines  
    #How to implement the assignment loop? 
    #Take list of tasks that we determined earlier can be filled, then start with most important task, but first check if it is a mulit hour / timeslot task if it is then (Nested loop?) take the pool of avialible employees and randomly select one, 
    #this probbaility can be modifyied by a pref variable which can make it more liely for certain employees to get certain tasks if they prefer them, this information would be stored somewhere in the program and could be modified by the user.
    #See if the selected employee is avialiable for next time slots or as long as needed for the long task, if not then cycle to next until find one? If it is not a long task then just randomly select from the available employee pool and employee, 
    #Also some tasks are gender dependent: but really only matters for specific special events that happen at a routine time every week: men-womans sessions & nightchores such as clenaing men or womens bathroom etc.
    #Randomly select person (Based on "people power" (lol) pool calc probbability of person recieving each task) #loop by person or task? does it matter??? -Person bc assigning it to a person
    #Then if can't assign all tasks in timeslot give error and add to final report what couldnt be assigned what was moved and why, and if able to fit into the schudle someowhere else maybe dont notify in final report?
#Print final scheudle output and error logs in console, also write resutls to CSV so can be the formatted or manually modified in excel or google sheets. Maybe if adapated as a google workspace add in it could directly output the information into the sheet then user made final adjsutments.

#ADDITONAL IDEAS
#idea to make more user friendly, make a final program that takes the csv file and converts it to an excel file that can be modified & styled by the user. Idk maybe even get it able to format the excel file - prob to complicated tho.
#resources for conversion and then formatting excel file:

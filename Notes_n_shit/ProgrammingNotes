Programming Notes


Keys() vs list() so for non printing cases where I need the keys .keys() is slightly more efficenty. But if I need it to print out i need to use list() on the keys so i dont get that weird dict_keys thing at the beginning. But overall doesn't really matter. The .keys() in pyhton 3x is a veiw object which is slightly more memory efficent. But unless bottleneck then prioritize readability. But if need .keys a bunch, easier just to create a list.


Code Notes and Style ---------


Optimization ---------------

Data Structures: Choose appropriate data structures for your problem. For example, dictionaries offer constant-time lookups, while lists may require linear time for certain operations.
Avoid Unnecessary Work: Review your code and eliminate any unnecessary computations or redundant operations.
Cache Results: If your function repeatedly performs the same calculations with identical inputs, consider caching the results to avoid redundant computation.
Parallelization: If your task is highly parallelizable, you can leverage Python's multiprocessing or threading modules to distribute the workload across multiple CPU cores.
